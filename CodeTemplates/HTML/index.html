    <h5>
        <p>In hip hop, so much can be explained by the rise and fall of record labels</p>

        <p>Lil Wayne's ascent iss the story of <b>Cash Money</b>. The Dirty South starts with <b>LaFace Records</b>. The east-coast/west-coast feud is <b>Bad Boy vs. Death Row</b>. In hip hop, the artist-label relationship isn't just a business deal, it's a commitment to an identity.</p>

        <p>We wanted to surface the notable labels in hip hop's history, so we measured every label by its artists' chart performance on Billboard (collaborating with <a href=https://twitter.com/KevinBeacham>Kevin Beacham</a> of <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhymesayers_Entertainment>Rhymesayers</a> to call out insights). By highlighting the labels who produced the most hits at any given time, we'd understand who was wielding enermous influence on hip hop's sound, distrubution, and direction.</p>
