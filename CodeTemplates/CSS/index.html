            Until recently, it was impossible to measure the popularity of older music.
            Billboard charts and album sales only tell us about a song's popularity at
            the time of its release.'

        <p><b>
            But now we have Spotify, a buffet of all music, new and old. Tracks with fewer
            plays are fading into obscurity. And those with more plays are remaining in the
            cultural ether.

        <p><b>
            20 years have passed since <i>N Diggity</i>'s release. Its popularity on Spotify,
            relative to every other song form the 90s, is a strong signal for whether it will
            be remembered by our children's children. So let's examine every song that ever
            charted, 1990-1999, and rank them by number of plays on Spotify, today.
